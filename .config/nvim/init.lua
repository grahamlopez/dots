Folding plugin idea: FIXME: move this to the nvim notes file

What I want is to use manual open/close commands as normal. Then, if a fold
needs to open automatically because the cursor moves into the region, that fold
should close when the cursor leaves, but only if it was opened automatically as
a result of the movement. Manually opened folds should remain open.

What Would Be Required

To achieve your desired behavior, you would need:
    A mechanism to track which folds were auto-opened (e.g., by search or cursor movement).
    Logic to close only those folds when the cursor leaves, leaving manually opened folds untouched.

This would require a custom Lua plugin that:
    Hooks into cursor movement and search events.
    Maintains a data structure tracking which folds were opened automatically.
    Closes only those folds when the cursor leaves their range.
